    <h1>The Law of Proximity</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.</p>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <span>The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists
    to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Pragnaz. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.</span>
